New Robotics Employee Reading List
===================================

Day 1 TODO List
----------------

The following is a TODO list for employees on their first day:

1. Be able to access your GTRI e-mail address:
   - [GTRI Outlook Web App](https://mail.gtri.gatech.edu/owa/?bO=1#path=/mail)
2. [Generate Your SSH Public Key](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key)
3. Add your SSH key to ATAS GitLab Servers:
   - [https://atas-gita.gtri.gatech.edu/](https://atas-gita.gtri.gatech.edu/)
   - [https://atas-gitb.gtri.gatech.edu/](https://atas-gitb.gtri.gatech.edu/)
4. Reading List / Tutorials (See links below):
   1. Read Git Book: Getting Started, Git Basics, Git Branching
   2. Skim C++ / Python Style Guides
   3. Read CMake Tutorial
   4. Complete Beginner ROS Tutorials

General Notes and Tips
-----------------------------

1. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use open source software packages that implement
   your desired algorithm and/or interface.
2. If you follow coding style guidelines, your code will be easier to read and
   less error-prone.
3. Ask questions.
4. We use Python for prototyping and testing new algorithms. Also, Python is
   great for post flight operations analysis. However, any heavy lifting that
   has real-time constraints should be implemented in C++.


Software Engineering
